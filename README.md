This project is part of my journey through Udacity's "Introducing Generative AI with AWS" program. 
Here's a quick look at what I did:

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- **Deploy Llama2** on AWS SageMaker
- **Evaluate** the pre-trained model
- **Fine-tune** the model with custom data
- **Deploy** the fine-tuned model
- **Test and evaluate** the fine-tuned model

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways
- Hands-on with AWS SageMaker
- Adapting models to specific domains
- Evaluating model performance
- Leveraging AWS scalability
